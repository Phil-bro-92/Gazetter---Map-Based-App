## Brief

Gazetteer is a mobile first website that will operate equally well on desktop. This application has a simple and clean UI, providing intuitive and user friendly navigation.

Countries can be selected from a dropdown and relative profiling information is returned to the user. This information is either displayed in overlays, for example the country border outline, or markers designating webcams. Other information about the country is presented within modals which can be accessed using onscreen buttons. The application also gives the user a choice over map style and map layers.

The system uses third party API's and the relevant information is returned via PHP routines. Calls to these PHP routines are made using AJAX functions. The Leaflet JS library was used to create the interactive maps along with plugins such as MarkerCluster and EasyButtons.
